# hello-world
Howdy, world. Just trying to learn github!

I'm currently working in the mortgage industry, but hope to become a software developer.
I've taken a few years of CS courses, dabbling in C++, Java, and Python. I wouldn't say I'm
a master at any of these languages, but I'm building a solid understanding of how to code.
